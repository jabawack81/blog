Lately, I've been immersing myself in content from software developer influencers, and I've noticed a recurring question in almost all the streams:

"I'm just starting in development. Which programming language should I learn, and what should I work on for my portfolio?"

So I thought I'd share my thoughts on this. First, let's address each question separately. From this point onward, we will work with the assumption that your goal is to land your first job as a developer and start a career.

## Which language should I learn?

This is the more complex of the two questions to answer, as the language you should learn depends on a variety of factors, including:

- The status of the market in your area or in the area you're planning to start working
- Your target job
- Your aptitude toward each language

Let me explain further:

### The status of the market in your area or the area you're planning to start working

This is perhaps the most important consideration to take into account. You could spend the next 2 years learning every aspect of a language, but if no one is hiring developers for that language, you'll have almost wasted that time. For example, I'm a Ruby developer, and I love it. However, at the time of writing, the Ruby market in London where I live is quite competitive. While the average salary is on the higher end, most companies are looking for developers with at least 3 years of commercial experience. Even if the job specs often list certain skills as "nice to have" rather than firm requirements, applying for jobs without meeting all the criteria can make your search more difficult. It could lead to many "we decided to proceed with a candidate with more experience" responses, which could be demoralizing. Therefore, although I love Ruby and think its simplicity and power make it perfect as a first language to learn, I hesitate to suggest it for people looking for their first web development job.

### Your target job

Although you can use almost any language for various purposes in today's environment, certain languages are more suited or provide more opportunities for specific job markets. For example, if your goal is to become a mobile developer, Python wouldn't be the best choice for you, even if there are mobile development projects written in Python.ivy](https://kivy.org/) that would allow you to do so this would restrict your employment options to the companies already using it, but at the same time if you're specifically targetting a company using it that's your answer and you can stop reading this and go learn it.

### Your attitude toward each language

This can seems strange but in my opinion each language has his own character and idiosinchranies and this could make it more or less suited for a specific developer, it's not something unsurmountable or impossible to cope with but it could take some experience to be able to adapt your way of thinking to a specific language and it become less and less of a problem with experience but at the beginning it could lead to some frustration and that's why I think it could be a good idea for you to shop around with a couple of languages before picking THE ONE considering your plan is to spent a good chunk of your wake time with it in the near future.

## What should I build?

This is quite a tricky question as again the answer depends on a number of factors, the industry and anguage you want to work in and if you're building something simply to learn the language or to build up your portfolio and showoff your skills; for the first of the two I would suggest you to look for and follow one of the many tutorial you can find online about building a simple applicaitons  the only suggestion I can give you is not to simply parrot what they tell you to do but try to understand the why otherwhise you could've simply copied the code from their GitHub to yours, and once done try to think how you would improve the software with new functionality or the UI/UX, for the latter the simplest answer is to look for problems around you and to solve them, doesn't really matter the size or complexity of the problem or the solution what it matter is to start building something! Small problems are almost the best place where to start as generally they have the simplest most straight forward solution and once you solved those you can start to tackle bigger and bigger problems.
This could seem like a useless endeavour but solving even small problems could help you to train your brain into coming up in ways to split a big problem in smaller and more manageable problems.
If you're working in a office at the moment you could look into how automate repetitive task with MS Office macros, even if you're not planning to have a career as a Visual basics developer the target should be learning the fundamentals of problem solving and software or maybe you could build a chrome or Firefox extension to add a button to fix that terrible web app you're forced to use.
