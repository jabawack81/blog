Lately, I've been immersing myself in content from software developer influencers and I've noticed a recurring question in almost all the streams:

"I'm just starting out in development. Which programming language should I learn, and what should I work on for my portfolio?"

So I thought I'd share my thoughts on this. First, let's address each question separately. From this point onward, we will work with the assumption that your goal is to land your first job as a developer and start a career.

Which language should I learn?

This is the more complex of the two questions to answer, as the language you should learn depends on a variety of factors, including:

- The status of the market in your area or the area you're planning to start working
- Your target job
- Your attitude toward each language

Let me explain further:

## The status of the market in your area or the area you're planning to start working

This is perhaps the most important consideration to take into account. You could spend the next 2 years learning every aspect of a language, but if no one is hiring developers for that language, you'll have almost wasted that time. For example, I'm a Ruby developer, and I love it. However, at the time of writing, the Ruby market in London where I live is quite competitive. While the average salary is on the higher end, most companies are looking for developers with at least 3 years of commercial experience. Even if the job specs often list certain skills as "nice to have" rather than firm requirements, applying for jobs without meeting all the criteria can make your search more difficult. It could lead to many "we decided to proceed with a candidate with more experience" responses, which could be demoralizing. Therefore, although I love Ruby and think its simplicity and power make it perfect as a first language to learn, I hesitate to suggest it for people looking for their first web development job.

## Your target job

Although you can use almost any language for various purposes in today's environment, certain languages are more suited or provide more opportunities for specific job markets. For example, if your goal is to become a mobile developer, Python wouldn't be the best choice for you, even if there are mobile development projects written in Python.ivy](https://kivy.org/) that would allow you to do so this would restrict your employment options to the companies already using it, but at the same time if you're specifically targetting a company using it that's your answer and you can stop reading this and go learn it.
